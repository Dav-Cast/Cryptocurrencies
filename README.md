The results are to be shared with the client as to make better decisions in terms of investment of cryptocurrency using multiple features such as: the amount mined, supplied, algorithm and prooftype of cryptocurrencies as the main feed of our model to predict clusters. 

## Results
For the model PCA was used to concatenate all the features to 3 values, the model used was K-Means and two graphs with tradable cryptocoins were made in order to convey a better visualization of the results obtained, the last plot was made with a scaled down information as to help the client get a better grasp of the results and not be overwhelmed by the quantities.
